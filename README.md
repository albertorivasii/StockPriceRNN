# Apple Stock Price Prediction RNN Model
## Skills Used: Python, Machine Learning, Recurrent Neural Network, Pandas, Numpy
### Data From: Yahoo Finance, 5Y as of 7/29/23
Personal Project of mine as I wanted to learn more about machine learning techniques in finance.  Google lead me to the concept of an RNN and I decided to try it myself.
Overall happy with how it came out.  I am glad I have some experience with machine learning especially in the finance industry.  Would love to spend more time improving this model and getting to understand the complexity of RNNs.

## Possibilities for Improvement:
- Adjust Dropout levels to try and look for over/undertuning
- Look for another RNN and see if that fits the data better
- Try this with the entirety of AAPL's life span on NASDAQ
- compute more epochs, RMSE went down by about 3 after running it 8 times or so.
