# Apple Stock Price Prediction RNN Model
## Skills Used: Python, Machine Learning, Recurrent Neural Network, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
### Data From: Yahoo Finance, 5Y as of 7/29/23
Personal Project of mine as I wanted to learn more about machine learning techniques in finance.  Google lead me to the concept of an RNN and I decided to try it myself.  Added a quick lineplot via Seaborn to visualize the actual price vs for model predictions.
Overall happy with how it came out.  I am glad I have some experience with machine learning especially in the finance industry.  Would love to spend more time improving this model and getting to understand the complexity of RNNs.

## Possibilities for Improvement:
- Adjust Dropout levels to try and look for over/undertuning
- Figure out why adding another LMST layer decreased model accuracy.  Maybe it is just not necessary.
- Create many to one model instead of one to one model using other variables such as open, change, and (adjusted) volume
